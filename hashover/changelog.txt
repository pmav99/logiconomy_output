-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Official mark of version 1.0!

All necessary files (source code and images) are now available via:

	ZIP archive: http://tildehash.com/hashover.zip
	GitHub: https://github.com/jacobwb/hashover

Please commit your changes to GitHub and make sure to read the GitHub page 
carefully for coding guidelines and copyright information.

Added new comment sorting feature with five sorting methods:

	In Order
	In Reverse Order
	By Commenter
	By Date (newest first)
	By Likes

Locale support, only three languages supported right now: English, Spanish, 
and Japanese. More languages will be added, those three are simply the ones 
of which I have at least some knowledge. More, further, and better translations 
are welcome and appreciated.

Individual IP addresses can now be blocked by adding them one per line to a 
file called "blocklist.txt" in the "hashover" directory. In addition to that, 
if the variable "$spam_IP_check" is set to 'php', 'javascript', or 'both' a 
visitor's IP address will be checked against stopforumspam.com's database.

E-mail notifications per comment can now be disabled by unchecking the 
"Subscribe" checkbox in the "Edit Comment" form.

Added administration support for deletion and editing of all comments. Just 
set the "$admin_nickname" and "$admin_password" variables in the "secrets.php" 
file to appropriate values. Read the "IMPORTANT" notice carefully.

Many, many major changes to accommodate said and following changes.
The script has been split into multiple files in "hashover/scripts" directory.
Removed all JavaScript from PHP-mode (except code for liking a comment).
"Reply" and "Edit" forms are now part of the dynamically generated HTML.

Added "Login" button. It simply sets the necessary cookies that allow users to 
edit, delete, and (un)subscribe to/from email notifications.

Removed Jeremiah Stoddard as secondary copyright holder since his 
contributions are no longer present in the current codebase, or rather, the 
codebase has changed enough that he would have no legal precedent to claim 
ownership any longer. Not that I expect any trouble.

Fixed bug that caused a comment to become uneditable after you post another 
comment with a different e-mail address as the last. Cause: conditions to 
display the "Edit" link were based on a name+e-mail+password scheme.

Renamed "comments.php" to "hashover.php".
Renamed "comments" directory to "hashover".
Moved code for automatic links and embedded images out of "write_comments.php"
Avatar icons that fail to load now get same style as when icons are disabled.
Temporarily disabled Identi.ca avatar support (see avatars.php) for why.
Added "reply" to "cmtdiv" CSS class elements to control how replies look.
Added "nickname" and "likes" to RSS feeds for use as API.
Removed name and horizontal row from RSS descriptions.
Now checks PHP version, fails if not 5.3.3 or higher.
Improved how comment deletion notices are handled.
Changed format of changelog.
Minor CSS changes.
Minor bug fixes.


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2013-03-31
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2013-03-20
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
External image URLs have to be wrapped in [img] and [/img] tags to appear.
Removed insecure "e" modifier from all preg_replace operations.
Improved how HTML tags are handled, including <code> escaping.

Bug fixed: URLs to image files automatically link again.
Bug fixed: User input of "\n" no longer phased in JavaScript.


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2013-03-18
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fixed bug causing "@username@identica" names to loss "@identica" when editing.
Fixed bug causing all "@" symbols to be removed from names.

Major changes to how HTML output is handled, most HTML has been moved 
into "/comments/templates/default.html", allowing for multiple comment 
styles and easy customization of HTML output and overall layout.


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2013-02-08
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Added code to display external images.
"comments.css" link tag no longer added to head if one already exists.
Now escaping single quotes instead of double quotes in JavaScript output.
"avatars.php" no longer uses cURL.

Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2012-12-03
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Applied patch by Solomon Peachy


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2012-10-29
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changed script execution time into JavaScript comment.
Fixed bug allowing external script usage via "canon_url".


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2012-10-07
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Many minor bug fixes.
Many major CSS changes.
Code clean-up, some variable name changes.
Avatar icon URLs added to RSS feed, allowing RSS feeds to act as an API.
Major "Edit" form redesign, editing "Name", "E-mail" and "Website" now allowed.
Comments only containing newlines and/or spaces are now treated as empty.
Now removing trailing newlines and spaces from comments before writing.
RSS feed "link" element now automatically added to page head element.
Fixed bug causing trailing newline when editing a comment.
Twitter/Identi.ca at-handles no longer part of name links.
Improved "<code>" tag method HTML character escaping.
CSS added to style "<pre>" and "<code>" tags.

Fixed bug causing "GET" requests to affect the file including "comments.php". 

	Explanation:

		File "phphome.php" includes "comments.php", like this:
			<?php $mode = 'php'; include("comments.php"); ?>

		Someone visits "phphome.php?rss=http://website.com/", the 
		RSS feed XML would be output on "phphome.php". Similar was 
		true for "phphome.php?count_link=http://website.com/".

Added loop to remove unwanted URL queries from comment directory names.

	Explanation:

		Add unwanted URL queries, one per line, to a file called 
		"ignore_queries.txt" under the "comments" directory.

		Adding just a query name without a value will remove the 
		query from comment directory names no matter what its value 
		is. Adding a query name with a value (name=value) will only 
		remove that specific query with that specific value from 
		comment directory names.

Content no longer written to document using JavaScript "document.write".

	Explanation:

		All content is now placed into the new "show_cmt" variable 
		and then written via "getElementById("hashover").innerHTML". 
		This allows the script to be deferrable (JavaScript 'defer' 
		tag), which means the script executes after the page is done 
		loading; a desirable behavior for some use cases.


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2012-10-06
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Major redesign of reply form and "Like", "Edit", and "Reply" buttons.

Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2012-07-12
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Applied patches by InaTux Computers. No changelog, so I'll do my best 
to list what has been changed.

	Comment replies no longer stored in sub-directories, now stored in 
	the same directory and named as <parent comment>-<reply number(s)>.

	Rationale: Solves a permissions bug where sub-directories aren't 
		   owned by a user who has permission to write to them.

		   Only a single directory is read. Making it faster.

		   Generating permalinks is as simple as:
		   #c<preg_replace('/-/', 'r', basename($file, '.xml'))>

		   Easier to read a comments tread via filenames.

	Comment threads now stored in "/comments/pages/<page URL>".
	Separated like functionality into "like.php" script.
	Many, many minor changes to accommodate said and following changes.

	Many "\n" newlines replaced with "PHP_EOL". This helps JavaScript 
	and HTML output look the same across different server platforms.

	"like.php", "avatars.php" and "secrets.php" moved into new 
	"scripts" directory. All images moved into new "images" directory.

	Fixed bug causing "Like" link to only be displayed when an 
	"E-mail Address" cookie is set. Anyone who hadn't commented yet 
	couldn't see the "Like" link.

	Renamed a few variables.
	Added a few code comments.
	Replaced "$fsroot_dir" variable with "chdir()".
	All mentions of "comments.php" in actual code removed.
	Separated "Default Settings" variables from URL cleaning code.
	Moved "Default Settings" variables back to the top of the code.
	Added more robust handling of "secrets.php" file inclusion.
	Added error message upon failed "secrets.php" file inclusion.
	Updated list of files to download in installation note.
	Spaced out some code structure for better readability.
	Separated deletion notice out into new "deletion_notice" function.
	Reworked handling of deleted comments.

	"All that, and a toilet!"

Added code to escape HTML tags inside <code> tags.
Added <code> tag to accepted HTML.
Fixed serious bugs.


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2011-21-08
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Added the "endtags" function for counting the number of open and closing HTML 
tags, if the number of open and closing HTML tags aren't the same it adds as 
many closing tags as necessary for each to the end of the file. Ensuring that 
tags left unclosed by a commenter won't affect the rest of the page. The 
function only closes accepted HTML tags, as that's all that's necessary.

Fixed a bug that caused the "Options" link to be displayed even when 
the options were displayed or were never hidden upon first time use 
or due to disabled/unaccepted cookies.


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2011-20-08
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fixed a bug that allowed anyone to use a blank password to delete any comment 
if a password wasn't given when the target comment was posted (thanks "Outis").

by specifying the title in the <script> tag via the "pagetitle" URL query.

Fixed a bug that caused a blank name if the "Website" field was disabled.

Fixed a bug that caused a message "You will not receive notification of 
replies to your comment without supplying an e-mail" to appear even if the 
"Email" field is disabled.

Now if all fields are disabled the "Options" link displays a message reading: 
"All Additional Options Disabled."


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2010-12-10
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fixed a bug that caused JavaScript syntax errors if an encrypted password 
contained a quote.


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2010-12-10
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changed code indention from spaced to tabbed.
Changed "Name" field to "Nickname".
Changed "Password (?)" field to "Password (Optional)".

Moved password field so as to appear right after the "Nickname" field, this 
way web browsers will store the "Name" field as username and the "Password" 
field as password, as opposed to "Website" being stored as the username.

Delete field is now auto-filled.


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2010-12-03
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Merged the two occurring RecursiveDirectoryIterator classes. This should 
make the comment system slightly more efficient as it will no longer read 
the "/comments" directory twice.

Renamed the password input fields' names stored in each comment file to fix 
a bug where the decrypted password would be saved to the comment file.

Renamed the "count_comments" function to "read_comments".


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2010-11-24
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Added functionality to display only the comment count by setting the 
"display" URL query to the page filename.

Added information about said functionality to the installation note.


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2010-11-06 to 2010-11-10
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Altered the "count_comments" function to use RecursiveDirectoryIterator and 
merged Jeremiah Stoddard's modifications with the "count_comments" function.

Added functionality to show a "This file has been deleted" note on first 
replies and all underlying replies. In other words the deleted comment 
recreation with a notice of deletion is now recursive.

Altered design implementations, like "Delete" comes before "Reply to Comments",
"if($file->isFile())" is now "if(is_file($file))", individual padding on 
comments, "Delete" link is now red, number of comments is displayed as:
"Showing 3 Comments (8 counting replies)" for example.

Fixed serious bugs.


Changes by Jeremiah Stoddard 2010-11-06
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Altered the unlink line to replace the file contents with the note
"This file has been deleted."

Altered the readfile() in line 334 to make a comparison to that note and 
skip the reply/delete links if file contents match the note.

Modified the script to find missing files and recreate them.


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2010-11-06
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Beginning of comment deletion functionality.

Added JavaScript function to display "Options" such as Name, Email, 
Website, etc., when replying.

Added a Password field, used to shore an encrypted password in each 
comment file for later use, such as deleting a comment.


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2010-11-05
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Made referrer checking stricter to avoid obscure directories created under 
"/comments" via external usage. This happened on Google search cache and 
other external websites that could remotely use the comment system by simply 
including "tildehash.com" in the page name or as a URL query.


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2010-11-04
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Added "<s>", "<ul>", "<ol>", "<li>", and "<blockquote>" as supported HTML.
Now removing second queries from referring URLs.


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2010-11-03
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fixed a bug that caused pages with URLs that contain numbers to include the 
numbers in the permalink.

Fixed a bug that caused the first comment's first reply to have the same 
permalink number as the 11th comment (1/1.txt = 11 & 11.txt = 11).

Moved the reply link out of the "data" variable and into the "read_comments" 
function, a reply link will no longer be written to each comment file.

Made some small layout changes.


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2010-10-23
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Added a warning message when a comment is posted without an email address.
Added a <noscript> tag to the installation code.


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2010-09-10
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm sort of confused about the comment counting method used for displaying a 
message when a comment has been deleted. There was (is?) a bug that caused it 
to display a "Comment Deleted" message after replies. I believe I've fixed 
this by adding the "deletedcomment" variable back in.


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2010-09-07
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Added encryption method for encrypting emails stored in comments; these emails 
are used for notifying a commenter of replies to his/her comment(s).

Added necessary form fields and code for storing encrypted emails and sending 
mail to commenter when another commenter replies to his/her comment(s).


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2010-07-29
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now we strip "../" from $_POST["reply_to"] thus "sanitizing" the value before 
using it. This helps prevent malicious usage (thanks mysterious 89.248.91.145.)

Added additional JavaScript functions for disabling comments, displaying 
comment form on bottom, setting "Comments" field height, disabling "Name" 
field, disabling "E-mail" field, and disabling "Website" field.

$deletedcount removed, $commentcount now used for tracking deleted comments.


Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2010-07-28
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Added if statement to mail() so that if the email given is the same as the 
email used for notification it won't send mail to the notification email.

Made the reply link trigger a JavaScript function that replaces it with a 
form to post a reply. This form also only shows the "Name", "E-mail 
Address", and "Website" fields if they don't have content from previous 
usage of the comments in the last month. 

Changed BBCode to normal HTML.

Added left padding to replies as indention, and added a closing div tag so 
that each reply is in its own div. Permalinks are now based on file 
basenames+subdirectory names.

Beginnings of a reply system. Need to indent replies. Also, the anchors now 
need to take into account the directory structure: basename("$dir/$file", 
".txt") alone is not sufficient enough to remain unique.

Removed line: header("Content-type: text/javascript"); from near the end of 
script (former line 172) as output already sent by former line 101: 
document.write("\n<form action=\"<?php echo $_SERVER["PHP_SELF"]; ?>\" method=\"post\">\n");

Added brief installation note

Added additional comments throughout code
